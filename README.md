# XML Calabash (2.x)

This repository contains the “2.x” version of XML Calabash.

XML Calabash 2.x depends on [Saxon](http://saxonica.com/) 9.8
and some recent version of
[JAFPL](http://jafpl.com/).

Welcome to the bleeding edge.

(There’s really nothing to see here; I’d have probably left this
repository private for a bit longer except that I want Travis CI
to see it.)
